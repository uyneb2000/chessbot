# chessbot
Chess bot created in school for Data Structures and Algorithms. 

GUI and server code was written by UW CSE staff.

Code written by my partner and I are found under src/chess/bots, src/chess/setup, and src/experiments.

Runs under several different bot algorithms: Minimax, Parallel Minimax, Alpha-beta Search, Parallel Alpha-beta Search.

Server can only be connected on the Google Compute Engine.
